# Summary
As part of UCLA's Student Research Program, this project explore using Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs) to encode Context-Free Grammar (CFG) and Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG). First, we compare the SDDâ€™s effectiveness in inducing a probability distribution over structured space against Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG). Second, we investigate both the feasibility and potential advantages of encoding CSG as an SDD. Our experimental results suggest that Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) can outperform PCFG in parsing ambiguous sentence structures.
