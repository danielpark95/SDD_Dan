Daniel hikes on the hill at school
a man gives a bone to dog
John throws the ball to the Mary
the Mary catches the ball at school
ball rolls down the hill on lawn
Daniel throws the ball at the man
Daniel drinks on the table in house
cat eats on the table in house
dog runs up the street at John
the Daniel eats soup with a spoon
