Daniel throws the ball down the street
the man gives the ball to Mary
a dog rolls on lawn at house
cat eats in the house on table
dog bites bone with cat at house
John eats on the table in house
Daniel eats at school on the table
dog drinks soup with cat at school
dog hikes up the hill with Mary
the man throws a spoon at John
